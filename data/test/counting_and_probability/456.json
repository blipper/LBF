{"problem":"For each integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the elements of the $n$th row (i.e. the row with $n+1$ elements) of Pascal's triangle minus the sum of all the elements from previous rows. For example, \\[f(2) = \\underbrace{(1 + 2 + 1)}_{\\text{2nd row}} - \\underbrace{(1 + 1 + 1)}_{\\text{0th and 1st rows}} = 1. \\]What is the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$?","level":"Level 4","type":"Counting & Probability"}
