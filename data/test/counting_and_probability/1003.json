{"problem":"When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1\/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1\/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1\/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \\frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m\/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.","level":"Level 5","type":"Counting & Probability"}
