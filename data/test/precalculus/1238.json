{"problem":"Three unit circles are drawn so they are mutually tangent, as shown below.  A blue circle that is externally tangent to all three unit circles is drawn.  Finally, three red circles are drawn, so that each red circle is externally tangent to two unit circles and externally tangent to the blue circle.  Then the radius of each red circle can be expressed in the form\n\\[\\frac{a - b \\sqrt{c}}{d},\\]where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, when simplified.  Find $a + b + c + d$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, O;\nreal s = 2\/sqrt(3) - 1, r = (9 - 4*sqrt(3))\/33;\n\nA = 2\/sqrt(3)*dir(150);\nB = 2\/sqrt(3)*dir(30);\nC = 2\/sqrt(3)*dir(270);\nO = (0,0);\nD = (r + s)*dir(330);\nE = (r + s)*dir(210);\nF = (r + s)*dir(90);\n\nfilldraw(Circle(O,s),blue);\nfilldraw(Circle(D,r),red);\nfilldraw(Circle(E,r),red);\nfilldraw(Circle(F,r),red);\ndraw(Circle(A,1));\ndraw(Circle(B,1));\ndraw(Circle(C,1));\n[\/asy]","level":"Level 5","type":"Precalculus"}
