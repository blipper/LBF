{"problem":"Let $P$ be the convex polygon in the complex plane whose vertices are the roots of\n\\[z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\\]The area of $P$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are positive integers, in simplest form.  Find $a + b + c + d.$","level":"Level 4","type":"Precalculus"}
