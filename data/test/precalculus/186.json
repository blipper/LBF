{"problem":"A cube has a side length of $s,$ and its vertices are $A = (0,0,0),$ $B = (s,0,0),$ $C = (s,s,0),$ $D = (0,s,0),$ $E = (0,0,s),$ $F = (s,0,s),$ $G = (s,s,s),$ and $H = (0,s,s).$  A point $P$ inside the cube satisfies $PA = \\sqrt{70},$ $PB = \\sqrt{97},$ $PC = \\sqrt{88},$ and $PE = \\sqrt{43}.$  Find the side length $s.$","level":"Level 4","type":"Precalculus"}
