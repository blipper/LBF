{"problem":"The solutions of the equation $z^4+4z^3i-6z^2-4zi-i=0$ are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane.  The area of this polygon can be expressed in the form $p^{a\/b},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.  Find $a + b + p.$","level":"Level 3","type":"Precalculus"}
