{"problem":"Two positive numbers $p$ and $q$ have the property that their sum is equal to their product. If their difference is $7$, what is $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}}$? Your answer will be of the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$ and $b$ don't both share the same common factor with $d$ and $c$ has no square as a factor. Find $a+b+c+d$.","level":"Level 5","type":"Algebra"}
