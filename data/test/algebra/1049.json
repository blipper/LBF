{"problem":"At constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. I have some hydrogen in a 3.67 liter container with a pressure of 4 kPa. If I move all of it to a 1.835 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?","level":"Level 3","type":"Algebra"}
