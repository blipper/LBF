{"problem":"An infinite geometric series has sum 2000.  A new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, has sum 16 times the sum of the original series.  The common ratio of the original series is $m\/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","level":"Level 5","type":"Algebra"}
