{"problem":"In base $10$, the number $2013$ ends in the digit $3$.  In base $9$, on the other hand, the same number is written as $(2676)_{9}$ and ends in the digit $6$.  For how many values of $b$ does the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ end in the digit $3$?","level":"Level 5","type":"Number Theory"}
