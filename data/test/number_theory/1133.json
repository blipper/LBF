{"problem":"If $a$ is a positive integer, then $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$ are also positive integers. We define the function $f$ such that $f(a)$ is the greatest common divisor of  $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.  Find the maximum possible value of $f(a)- a$.","level":"Level 4","type":"Number Theory"}
