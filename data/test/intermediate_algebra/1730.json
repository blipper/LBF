{"problem":"Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers such that $-1 < x < y < 1.$  Let $G$ be the sum of the infinite geometric series whose first term is $x$ and whose common ratio is $y,$ and let $G'$ be the sum of the infinite geometric series whose first term is $y$ and whose common ratio is $x.$  If $G = G',$ find $x + y.$","level":"Level 3","type":"Intermediate Algebra"}
