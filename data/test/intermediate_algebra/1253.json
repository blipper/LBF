Then the minimum value of\n\\[\\frac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z}\\]is of the form $\\frac{a \\sqrt{b}}{c},$ for some positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ where $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime, and $b$ is not divisible by the square of a prime.  Enter $a + b + c.$","level":"Level 5","type":"Intermediate Algebra"}
