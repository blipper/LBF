{"problem":"Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 2011 such that $P(1) = 0,$ $P(2) = 1,$ $P(4) = 2,$ $\\dots,$ $P(2^{2011}) = 2011.$  Then the coefficient of $x$ in $P(x)$ can be expressed in the form\n\\[a - \\frac{1}{b^c},\\]where $a,$ $b,$ $c$ are positive integers, and $b$ is prime.  Find $a + b + c.$","level":"Level 5","type":"Intermediate Algebra"}
