{"problem":"A square region $ABCD$ is externally tangent to the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=1$ at the point $(0,1)$ on the side $CD$.  Vertices $A$ and $B$ are on the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=4$.  The side length of this square can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}-c}{d}$, where $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $a$, $c$, and $d$ share no common factors. Find $a+b+c+d$.","level":"Level 4","type":"Intermediate Algebra"}
